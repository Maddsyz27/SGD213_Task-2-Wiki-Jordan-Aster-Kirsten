## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

**Dual Weapon System**
Players can switch between two firearms. Restrictive use of each firearm with be only when each firearm is equipped. Only one firearm can be equipped at a time.

**Grenade Mechanic**
A throwable grenade adds strategic depth and will allow players to manage groups of enemies.​

**Basic Enemy AI**
Enemies patrol predefined areas and, once the player is within a certain range, will orient themselves to face the player. This will enhance immersion without introducing complex combat behaviors.​

**Player Movement**
Responsive controls will enable players to navigate the environment smoothly with basic movement mechanics inclusive of a jump mechanism.​

**Health System**
Players can recover health through pickups scattered around the environment OR by using items stored in their inventory.​ - (waiting on Client's decision)

**HUD Interface**
A minimal HUD interface for the player to view health status, ammunition count for eqipped weapon, grenade indicator with count available, and currently equipped weapon. This will ensure the player has crucial real time feedback during gameplay. A centralised crosshairs will also aid in precision.
