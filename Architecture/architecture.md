# Component-based pattern with Inheritance architecture 

As we are a small development team with a tight schedule to complete this project and limited experience in C# and Unity, component based architecture would allow us to quickly implement the required components efficiently. However, to reduce some code duplication, we will also incorporate basic inheritance to help create a modular and reusable structure. This will help to simplifying hierarchies and make the relationships between component scripts more understandable. This approach also aligns with Unity’s design philosophy. 
 
 With this structure in mind, we would also like to add object pooling to help improve performance for instances like grenades, bullets, pickups and enemies. In addition, this FPS template project will cater as a practical learning tool for students to observe the basic construction of more advanced coding map.
